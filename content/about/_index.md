I am a researcher in financial economics with a focus on empirical asset pricing,
fixed-income markets, and the dynamics between pension-fund flows, illiquidity,
and sovereign yield curves.

I am completing a Master's in Economic Engineering at the National University of
Engineering (UNI), where I specialize in asset-pricing theory, econometrics, and
the structure of capital markets in emerging economies.
